# katana-tee

TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) attestation support for Katana.

## Overview

This crate provides abstractions for generating hardware-backed attestation quotes that cryptographically bind Katana's blockchain state to a TEE measurement. When running Katana inside a TEE, clients can request attestation quotes that prove the sequencer is executing within a secure, isolated environment.

## What is TEE?

A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a secure area within a processor that guarantees code and data loaded inside are protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. TEEs provide:

- **Isolation**: Code executing inside a TEE is isolated from the rest of the system, including the operating system and hypervisor
- **Attestation**: Hardware-backed proof that specific code is running inside a genuine TEE
- **Integrity**: Guarantee that the code and data have not been tampered with

## Supported Platforms

### AMD SEV-SNP

AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP) is a hardware security feature available on AMD EPYC processors (3rd Gen or later). See the [References](#references) section for detailed documentation.

**Requirements:**
- AMD EPYC processor with SEV-SNP support
- Linux kernel with SEV-SNP guest support
- Access to `/dev/sev-guest` device

To enable SEV-SNP support, compile with the `snp` feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
katana-tee = { features = [ "snp" ], .. }
```

## Verifying Attestation Quotes

SEV-SNP attestation quotes can be verified using:

1. **AMD's Key Distribution Service (KDS)** - Fetches the certificate chain for verification
2. **sev-snp-measure** - Tool for measuring and verifying SEV-SNP guests
3. **Custom verification** - Parse the attestation report and verify the signature chain

The quote contains:
- Measurement of the guest VM
- User-provided report data (the Poseidon hash commitment)
- Hardware-signed attestation from AMD's security processor

## Feature Flags

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `snp` | Enables AMD SEV-SNP support via the `sev-snp` crate |

## Security Considerations

- TEE attestation only proves code is running in a TEE; it does not verify the correctness of the code itself
- The attestation binds to a specific state; verifiers should check the block number/hash is recent
- Quote generation requires hardware access; quote generation will return errors on unsupported platforms
- The 64-byte report data is a Poseidon hash of `H_poseidon(state_root, block_hash)`, padded with zeros
