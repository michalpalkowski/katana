//! Stage-based blockchain synchronization pipeline.
//!
//! This module provides a [`Pipeline`] for executing multiple [`Stage`]s sequentially to
//! synchronize blockchain data. The pipeline processes blocks in configurable chunks and can be
//! controlled via a [`PipelineHandle`].
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The pipeline follows the [staged sync] architecture inspired by the [Erigon] Ethereum client.
//! Rather than performing all synchronization tasks concurrently, the sync process is decomposed
//! into distinct stages that execute sequentially:
//!
//! - **Sequential Execution**: Stages run one after another in a defined order, with each stage
//!   completing its work before the next stage begins.
//!
//! - **Isolation**: Each stage focuses on a specific aspect of synchronization (e.g., downloading
//!   block headers, downloading bodies, executing transactions, computing state). This separation
//!   makes each stage easier to understand, profile, and optimize independently.
//!
//! - **Checkpointing**: The pipeline tracks progress through checkpoints. Each stage maintains its
//!   own checkpoint, allowing the pipeline to resume from where it left off if interrupted.
//!
//! - **Chunked Processing**: Blocks are processed in configurable chunks, allowing for controlled
//!   progress and efficient resource usage.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use katana_pipeline::Pipeline;
//! use katana_provider::DbProviderFactory;
//! use katana_stage::Stage;
//!
//! # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // Create a provider factory for stage checkpoint management
//! let provider = DbProviderFactory::new_in_memory();
//!
//! // Create a pipeline with a chunk size of 100 blocks
//! let (mut pipeline, handle) = Pipeline::new(provider, 100);
//!
//! // Add stages to the pipeline (executed in order)
//! // pipeline.add_stage(MyDownloadStage::new());
//! // pipeline.add_stage(MyExecutionStage::new());
//!
//! // Subscribe to block notifications to monitor sync progress
//! let mut block_subscription = handle.subscribe_blocks();
//!
//! // Spawn a task to monitor synced blocks
//! tokio::spawn(async move {
//!     while let Ok(Some(block_num)) = block_subscription.changed().await {
//!         println!("Pipeline synced up to block: {}", block_num);
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! // Spawn the pipeline in a background task
//! let pipeline_task = tokio::spawn(async move { pipeline.run().await });
//!
//! // Set the target tip block to sync to
//! handle.set_tip(1000);
//!
//! // Later, update the tip as new blocks arrive
//! handle.set_tip(2000);
//!
//! // Stop the pipeline gracefully when done
//! handle.stop();
//!
//! // Wait for the pipeline to finish
//! pipeline_task.await??;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
