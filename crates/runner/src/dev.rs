//! Katana Dev Client
//!
//! This simple clients exposes the Katana Dev API.
//!
//! This is a "duplicate" from the client that can be found
//! under the `katana-rpc-api` crate. However, this client
//! doesn't require to import `katana-rpc-api` which depends
//! on `katana-primitives` which introduce a coupling to the
//! cairo version that has to be used.
//!
//! In the same spirit that the Katana Runner is interacting
//! with Katana from the CLI to avoid any coupling, this
//! client is a simple client that doesn't depend on any
//! other crate of Katana.
